# opencv_exps
random scripts I wrote while experimenting with opencv, using python

opencv is a cross-platform library used for image processing, video analysis and computer vision.
supports many languages like java, python, c++ etc
.imread() - to read an image

image[pixelsize, pixelsize] - to traverse eg to get bgr value

image[pixel1 : pixel2, pixel3 : pixel4] - to get certain region of interest

.resize(image, (size, size)) - to resize eg cv2.resize(image, (100,100))

.imshow() - to display image

.destroyAllWindows() - destroy all windows lol

.rectange() - takes 5 arguments, draws a rectangle eg:(image, top dim, bottom dim, rgb vals, width )
